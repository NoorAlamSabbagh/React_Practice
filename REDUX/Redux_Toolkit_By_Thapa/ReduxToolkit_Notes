Redux Toolkit is an official toolset from the Redux team that makes working with Redux easier and less time-consuming.

Instead of doing everything manually-like creating actions, reducers, and managing state immutability-RTK gives you
built in functions that handles most of the work for you.

In simpler terms, its a shortcut that helps you manage your app's state with code and fewer mistakes.
The goal is to make Redux more begineer friendly thatreduce the amount of code you need to write.
